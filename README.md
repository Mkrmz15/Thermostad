In this project, I designed a thermostat with an adjustable temperature set value using Arduino Uno, 2x16 LCD and DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor.I used a green and red button in the circuit. While increasing the set value with the green button , we can decrease it with the red button. Each time we press the buttons, the set value decreases and increases by 0.5 C on the LCD. I produced a duty cycle adjustable pwm signal depending on the difference between the set value and ambient temperature.There is a LED on the 6th pin. As the difference between the ambient temperature and the set value changes, you can see that the brightness of our red LED changes.
