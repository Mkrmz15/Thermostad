In this project, I designed a thermostat with an adjustable temperature set value using Arduino Uno, 2x16 LCD and DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor.I used a green and red button in the circuit. While increasing the set value with the green button, we can decrease it with the red button. Each time we press the buttons, the set value decreases or increases by 0.5 C on the LCD. I produced a duty cycle adjustable pwm signal depending on the difference between the set value and ambient temperature.There is a LED on the 6th pin. As the difference between the ambient temperature and the set value increases, you can see that the brightness of our red LED increases due to increased duty cycle of the pwm. I limited the set value between 16 and 32C and assumed that the difference between current and target temperature is max 16C and min 0C. Thus, when the difference between them is 16C, the duty cycle is 100%, whereas when the difference is 0, the duty cycle will be 0 and the led will turn off.
